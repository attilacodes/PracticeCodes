#Random Walk Exercise#
######################

# Roll a dice. 
# If you roll 1 or 2, you step back 1
# If you roll 3, 4, 5 you step forward 1
# If you roll 6, you can roll again and step forward the amount you rolled 

# Importing NumPy as np
import numpy as np

# Setting seed to a random integer (pseudo-random)
np.random.seed(123)    # Seed makes sure that the random integers are always the same (hence pseudo-random)

# Initialization
random_walk = [0]    # Creating a list with where the random walk start at 0

# Creating a loop
for x in range(100) :    # Reiterating 100 times
    step = random_walk[-1]    # Setting step equal to the last element in the list
    dice = np.random.randint(1,7)    # Dice is equal to a randomly generated number between 1-6 (seed makes sure that the same number is rolled on each turn)

    if dice <= 2:
        step = max(0, step - 1)
    elif dice <= 5:
        step = step + 1
    else:
        step = step + np.random.randint(1,7)

    random_walk.append(step)    # Adding the number of steps to the list

# Import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Plot random_walk
plt.plot(random_walk)

# Show the plot
plt.show()
